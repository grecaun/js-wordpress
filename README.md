# JS Wordpress Theme

This is a wordpress theme based upon [underscores][underscores] using [bootstrap][bootstrap].

The color scheme and layout should be fairly customizeable.

## Instalation

For the easiest install, download the zip in this repo and install it via the theme choser on wordpress.

You can also place the entirety of the js-wordpress folder in the `%YOURWORDPRESSDIRECTORY%/wp-content/themes/` folder.

## Cusomization Options

 * Colors - Font colors, navigation bar color (and footer) link colors, etc.
 * Width - Sidebar and main content is modifiable.
 * Sidebar Placement - Left or Right
 * Templates - Able to make a page without the title showing, there is also the option to make photo galleries.
 * Copyright tag - Easily changeable.
 * Menus - Navbar menu and a footer menu.
 * Header Image - Choose a header image, you can also choose a smaller header to use for mobile.

## Photo Gallery Template (Album)

This template expects there to be a folder in the theme folder full of images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif).  Within this folder should also be another folder called thumbs with thumbnails of the images. The name of the outer folder must match the page slug when you create the page.  Without these folders in the correct spot nothing will show.

## Artwork

The default header is based on this [image][header].
